# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! Before you start, please read the following guidelines carefully.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, follow these steps:
1. Ensure the bug hasn't already been reported by searching the [issues](https://github.com/intales/gazelle/issues).
2. If the bug is not reported, open a new issue with a detailed description of the problem, how to reproduce it, and, if possible, relevant screenshots or error messages.

### Proposing New Features

If you have an idea for a new feature:
1. Check if someone has already proposed a similar feature in the [issues](https://github.com/intales/gazelle/issues).
2. If you don't find anything similar, open a new issue describing your idea and why you think it would be useful.

### Improving Documentation

Good documentation is key to the success of any project. You can help by:
1. Fixing typos or grammatical errors in the existing documentation.
2. Adding more detailed explanations or examples to help users understand how to use the project.
3. Creating new documentation for features that are not well covered.

### Discussing Changes

Before you start writing code and opening a pull request, please discuss your ideas openly with the community:
1. Open a new issue or comment on an existing one to describe the changes you plan to make.
2. Engage in discussion to get feedback and ensure that your contribution aligns with the project's goals and roadmap.
