## Getting started

### Installation

To start using Gazelle in your Dart project, simply add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yaml
dependencies:
  gazelle_core: <latest-version> 
```
Then, run `dart pub get` or `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Example usage

Here's a quick example of how to create a simple Gazelle server:
```dart
import 'package:gazelle_core/gazelle_core.dart';

void main() async {
  final app = GazelleApp(
    routes: [
      GazelleRoute(
        name: "hello_gazelle",
        get: (context, request, response) => GazelleResponse(
          statusCode: GazelleHttpStatusCode.success.ok_200,
          body: "Hello, Gazelle!",
        ),
      ),
    ],
  );

  await app.start();
  print("Gazelle listening at ${app.serverAddress}");
}
```
That's it! You've just created a basic Gazelle server that responds with "Hello, Gazelle!"
to any incoming requests to the root route.
