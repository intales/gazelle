# Gazelle Context

At its core, `GazelleContext` serves as the central hub for managing routes and plugins within a Gazelle application.

## Route management
The `GazelleContext` houses a `GazelleRouter`, which is responsible for handling route registration and searching.
When you insert a new route using methods like insertRoute, get, post, etc., the context delegates the task to the router.
Similarly, when a request arrives, the context uses the router to search for the appropriate route to handle it.

## Plugin Management
In addition to route management, `GazelleContext` handles the registration and initialization of plugins.
When you register a plugin with the context using the register method, it adds the plugin to its internal registry.
The context then initializes the plugin, allowing it to perform any setup tasks or configurations necessary for operation.

## Scalability and Flexibility
One of the key advantages of `GazelleContext` is its scalability and flexibility.
It provides a structured and organized way to manage routes and plugins, making it easy to build and maintain complex applications.
Plus, thanks to its modular design, developers can add or remove routes and plugins dynamically, without disrupting the overall functionality of the application.

## Context Hierarchy
`GazelleContext` supports a hierarchical structure, allowing for nested contexts.
This feature enables developers to create context hierarchies, where child contexts inherit routes and plugins from their parent contexts.
It's particularly useful for organizing code and managing dependencies in large applications.

## Plugin Interaction
Plugins in Gazelle can interact with the context and with each other,
enabling collaboration and integration between different parts of the application.
For example, a logging plugin might log information about incoming requests, while an authentication plugin verifies the identity of users.
By leveraging the context, plugins can share data and resources, leading to more cohesive and powerful applications.

In essence, `GazelleContext` acts as the glue that holds together the various components of a Gazelle application.
It provides a unified interface for managing routes and plugins, facilitating the development of scalable, modular, and maintainable web applications.
So whether you're building a simple API or a complex microservice architecture, `GazelleContext` has got you covered!
