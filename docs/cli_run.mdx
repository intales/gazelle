## Options
You have a couple of options to run your project.
You can specify the path of
the project with `-p` (or `--path`).
Example:
```shell
gazelle run -p my_awesome_app/packages/backend
```
You can also define the hot-reloading timeout with `-t` (or `--timeout`).
Example:
```shell
gazelle run -t 800
```
The above command sets the hot-reloading timeout to 800 [ms], default is 1000 [ms].
