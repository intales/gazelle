# Creating new handlers

We have created a new `users` route for our system to fetch the existing
users, now we want to create a new handler to add a new user into our
system.

## Create a handler

Let's use the CLI to create a new handler for the `users` route.
At the root of our project run the following command:
```shell
gazelle create handler
```
The CLI will ask to pick a route from a selection menu, let's pick the
`users` route:
```console
$ gazelle create handler
Pick a route:                                                                                               
    HelloGazelle                                                                                                
--> Users                                                                                                       
```
Then, pick the `POST` method:
```console
Pick a method:                                                                                              
--> POST                                                                                                        
    PUT                                                                                                         
    PATCH                                                                                                       
    DELETE                                                                                                      
```
The CLI will then create the handler source file inside the `users` route
directory.

## Create an entity for our handler

Now we need to create an entity to define the data to create a new user.
Let's create a new entity called `new_user.dart` inside the models directory.
Copy-paste the following code in the newly created file:
```dart
class NewUser {
  final String name;
  final String username;

  const NewUser({
    required this.name,
    required this.username,
  });
}
```
Then, let's run `gazelle codegen models` inside the terminal.
