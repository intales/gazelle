# Plugins

Think of plugins in Gazelle as add-on modules that supercharge your application with extra functionality.
They're like power-ups for your web server or API, giving you cool features without the hassle of building them from scratch.

With plugins, you can do all sorts of cool stuff, like adding authentication, logging requests, or validating user input.
They're like building blocks that you can mix and match to create the perfect setup for your project.

Plugins are independent from each other, so you can use them however you want, think of them like lego bricks
that can be used in multiple ways.

## Registering a plugin
Every plugin is a standalone package that depends on the `gazelle_core` package.
To register a plugin, you need to import its package from [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/) or a git repository, then you need to register it inside
your `GazelleApp`.
Here's an example on how to do this using the `GazelleJwtPlugin`:
```dart
import 'package:gazelle_core/gazelle_core.dart';
import 'package:gazelle_jwt/gazelle_jwt.dart';

void main() async {
  // Initialize your Gazelle app.
  final app = GazelleApp();
  // Register GazelleJwtPlugin.
  await app.registerPlugin(GazelleJwtPlugin("supersecret"));
}
```
The example above imports `GazelleJwtPlugin` from its package, then it gets registered from `GazelleApp`.

## Using a plugin
Using a plugin is pretty straight forward, `GazelleApp` and `GazelleContext` both have a `getPlugin` method that's really easy to use.
Here's a quick example on how to use it:
```dart
// Assume we already set up our `GazelleApp`

// Setup your routes.
  app.post(
      "/login",
      (request) async {
        // Use the request to get data sent from the client.
        return GazelleResponse(
          statusCode: 200,
          // Sign a token and send it back to the client.
          body: app.getPlugin<GazelleJwtPlugin>().sign({"test": "123"}),
        );
      },
    );
```

That's it! You just learned how to use a Gazelle plugin, you can learn how they work and how to write one [here](/ecosystem_overview)!
