# Getting Started with Gazelle
This guide will walk you through the process of getting started with Gazelle and building your first HTTP server.

## Installation
To install Gazelle in your Dart project, add it as a dependency in your pubspec.yaml file:
```yaml
dependencies:
  gazelle_core: <latest-version>
```
Then, run pub get to fetch and install the package.

## Creating Your First Server
Once Gazelle is installed, you can create a simple HTTP server with just a few lines of code.
Here's an example:
```dart
import 'package:gazelle_core/gazelle_core.dart';

void main() async {
  final app = GazelleApp();

  app.get('/', (request) async => GazelleResponse(
    statusCode: 200,
    body: 'Hello, Gazelle!',
  ));

  await app.start();
  print('Server is running at http://${app.address}:${app.port}');
}
```
In this example, we create a new instance of a `GazelleApp`, define a route for the root path `/`,
and specify a request handler that returns a simple `Hello, Gazelle!` response.
Finally, we start the server using the `start()` method.

## Handling Requests
Gazelle provides a powerful routing system that allows you to handle different HTTP methods and paths with ease.
You can define routes using methods like get, post, put, delete, etc., and specify request handlers to process incoming requests.
```dart
app.get('/hello', (request) async => GazelleResponse(
  statusCode: 200,
  body: 'Hello, World!',
));
```
In this example, we define a route for the path `/hello` using the get method and specify a request handler that returns a `Hello, World!` response.

## Adding Hooks and Plugins
Gazelle allows you to enhance your application's functionality using hooks and plugins.
Hooks enable you to execute functions before and after request handlers, while plugins provide a way to extend Gazelle with custom features.
```dart
// Registering a plugin
await app.registerPlugin(GazelleJwtPlugin("supersecret"));

// Using a hook
app.get(
  "/protected",
  (request) async {
    return GazelleResponse(
      statusCode: 200,
      body: "Protected Route",
    );
  },
  preRequestHooks: [app.getPlugin<GazelleJwtPlugin>().authenticationHook],
);
```
In this example, we register a JWT authentication plugin and apply an authentication hook to a protected route.

## Next Steps
Congratulations! You've created your first Gazelle server. Now, explore the documentation further to learn about Gazelle's advanced features,
including middleware, error handling, and more.
