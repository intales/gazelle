# Dockerize

The `dockerize` command creates a Dockerfile at the root of your project with
the necessary settings to build a docker image.
You can build the image by yourself with docker, or you can upload your source code
to something like [GCP Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build?hl=en) and serve it with [GCP Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run?hl=en), or any other cloud provider
of your choice.

To create a Dockerfile just run:
```shell
gazelle dockerize
```
That's it, you now have a Dockerfile ready to ship!

## Options
The `dockerize` command can be customized with a TCP port of your choice (defaults to "3000").
An example:
```shell
gazelle dockerize -p 8080
```
