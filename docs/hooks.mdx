# Hooks
Hooks in Gazelle allow you to execute functions before and after request handlers,
enabling you to customize the behavior of your application at various stages of request processing.

<Warning>If you set the status code of the response between `400` and `599`, the server will stop processing
hooks and handlers and will send the response to the client.</Warning>

### Pre-request Hooks
Pre-request hooks are functions that are executed before a request is handled.
They can be used for tasks such as authentication, authorization, logging, etc.
Here's an example of using a pre-request hook to authenticate requests:
```dart
// Creating a pre-request hook for authentication
final authenticationHook = GazellePreRequestHook(
  (request, response) async {
    // Perform authentication logic here
    if (!isAuthenticated(request)) {
      final response = GazelleResponse(
        statusCode: 401,
        body: 'Unauthorized',
      );
      return (request, response);
    }

    // If authentication succeeds, continue processing the request
    return (request, response);
  },
  // Share this hook with child routes, false by default
  shareWithChildRoutes: true,
);

final app = GazelleApp(
  routes: [
    GazelleRoute(
      name: "protected",
      preRequestHooks: (context) => [authenticationHook],
      get: (context, request, response) {
        return GazelleResponse(
          statusCode: GazelleHttpStatusCode.success.ok_200,
          body: "Protected",
        );
      },
      children: [
        GazelleRoute(
          name: "user_info",
          get: (context, request, response) {
            return GazelleResponse(
              statusCode: GazelleHttpStatusCode.success.ok_200,
              body: "User Info",
            );
          },
        )
      ],
    ),
  ],
);
```
In this example, the pre-request hook for authentication is applied to the main path `/protected`.
This hook will be automatically shared with all child routes under `/protected`, such as `/protected/user_info`.
Each request sent to these child routes will undergo the authentication hook before being handled by the respective request handling function.

### Post-response Hooks
Post-response hooks are functions that are executed after a response is generated.
They can be used for tasks such as logging, response modification, etc.
Post-response hooks receive the generated response and can modify it before it's sent back to the client.

Here's an example of using a post-response hook to add custom headers to the response:
```dart
// Creating a post-response hook to add custom headers
final customHeadersHook = GazellePostResponseHook(
  (request, response) async {
    final response = GazelleResponse(
      // Add custom headers to the response
      headers: {...response.headers, 'X-Custom-Header': 'Value'},
      // Optionally modify the response body or status code
      body: "${response.body} (modified)",
      statusCode: GazelleHttpStatusCode.success.ok_200,
    );
    // Return the modified response
    return (request, response);
  },
  // Share this hook with child routes, false by default
  shareWithChildRoutes: true,
);

final app = GazelleApp(
  routes: [
    GazelleRoute(
      name: "data",
      postResponseHooks: (context) => [customHeadersHook],
      get: (context, request, response) {
        return GazelleResponse(
          statusCode: GazelleHttpStatusCode.success.ok_200,
          body: "Data",
        );
      },
      children: [
        GazelleRoute(
          name: "info",
          get: (context, request, response) {
            return GazelleResponse(
              statusCode: GazelleHttpStatusCode.success.ok_200,
              body: "Info",
            );
          },
        ),
      ],
    )
  ],
);
```
In this example, the post-response hook for adding custom headers is applied to the main path `/data`.
This hook will be automatically shared with all child routes under `/data`, such as `/data/info`.
After the response is generated for each request, the post-response hook will be executed to add custom headers before sending the response back to the client.
