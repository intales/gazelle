# Project structure

The structure of a Gazelle full-stack project is not so different from
a standard Flutter project. The main difference is the presence of a directory
called `backend`.

## The backend directory

This directory holds everything that's related to Gazelle.
It has 3 sub-directories:

1. client 
2. models
3. server

### The client directory

Here, you'll find the strongly-typed client for your Flutter application.
We won't look at it very much, as it gets generated by the CLI.

### The models directory

This directory is used to define your entities for the application.
It has 2 sub-directories:

1. entities
2. models

We will put our custom entities inside the `entities` directory, the `models`
directory is handled by the CLI, it holds the serialization and deserialization
logic, and it is shared between the `server` and the `client` directories.

### The server directory

We will spend most of our time here, creating routes, hooks, registering plugins
and creating the business logic for our amazing application.

The folder structure is pretty straight forward, you have your main file wich
is `server.dart` and your routes under the `routes` directory.

## Flutter setup

The Flutter application gets set up for you when you create a new full-stack
project. If you look closely at your `pubspec.yaml` you should notice that
you have a dependency to your backend client.
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  client:
    path: backend/client
```
The `main.dart` file of the Flutter app is also different.
It contains the most basic code to initialize the client and use it.

## Next steps

In the next part of this guide, we will try to add a custom entity to our
project and use it to create a new route for our application.
