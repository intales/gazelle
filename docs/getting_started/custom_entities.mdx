# Custom entities

Returning a simple string is fun and all, but at some point we will need to
define custom entities for our application. Gazelle offers a simple way
to define them and handles serialization out of the box via code generation.
That's right, you don't need to create `fromJson` and `toJson` methods or use
libraries like `json_serializable`.

## Define an entity

Let's say that we want to create an entity that defines a user inside our
system, the `User` entity will just have a couple of properties for the sake
of simplicity of this tutorial.

Open up your `backend/models/lib/entities` directory and create a new file
called `user.dart`.
<Image src="/assets/custom_entities_1.png" alt="user.dart file" />

Open your newly created file and copy-paste the following code:
```dart
class User {
  final String id;
  final String name;
  final String username;

  const User({
    required this.id,
    required this.name,
    required this.username,
  });
}
```

Now, run
```shell
gazelle codegen models
```
inside your terminal, you should see the following output:
```console
âœ… Models generated ðŸš€
```

This means that Gazelle successfully created serialization logic for the `User`
entity. If you look inside the `models` directory, you should see a file
named `user_model_type.dart`.
This file holds the necessary logic to transform the `User` entity from and to
json, if you open the file you should see exactly this:
```dart
import 'package:gazelle_serialization/gazelle_serialization.dart';

import '../entities/user.dart';

class UserModelType extends GazelleModelType<User> {
  @override
  User fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    return User(
      id: json["id"] as String,
      name: json["name"] as String,
      username: json["username"] as String,
    );
  }

  @override
  Map<String, dynamic> toJson(User value) {
    return {
      "id": value.id,
      "name": value.name,
      "username": value.username,
    };
  }
}
```

<b>DO NOT TOUCH</b> this file, it should be handled <b>ONLY</b> by the CLI.
