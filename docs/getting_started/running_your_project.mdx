# Running your project

Now that you have created a full-stack project with Gazelle, we're pretty sure
that you want to execute it for the first time.

## Open the project

First things first, we need to open up the project in our favourite code editor.
For the sake of this guide,
we will use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

To open your project in VS Code, navigate into your project directory:
```shell
cd my_amazing_app
```
And open VS Code:
```shell
code .
```

## Run the server

To start the Gazelle server just run
```shell
gazelle run
```
inside the VS Code terminal.

This command will start your backend application and will enable server
hot-reloading, giving you the ability to update and fix your code without
restarting the server everytime.

You should see something like this inside your terminal:
```console
✅ Running Project 'backend'...
Press 'r' to hot-reload the project.
Press 'R' to hot-restart.
Ctrl+c to exit.

The Dart VM service is listening on http://127.0.0.1:8181/RGz926BJ-bs=/
The Dart DevTools debugger and profiler is available at: http://127.0.0.1:8181/RGz926BJ-bs=/devtools?uri=ws://127.0.0.1:8181/RGz926BJ-bs=/ws
```

## Run the Flutter application

Now, you only need to fire up your frontend, open up an iOS Simulator or
Android Emulator and start your Flutter app as usual - in this guide we're
going to launch it directly from VS Code.

This is what you should see:

## Update the `hello_gazelle` route handler

Let's try to change the response of the `hello_gazelle` route handler to test
server-side hot-reloading.
First, from the root of your project, navigate to
`backend/server/lib/routes/hello_gazelle/hello_gazelle_get.dart`
and open up the source file.

Now, we want to update the response body from <b><i>Hello, Gazelle!</i></b> to
something like <b><i>Hello, amazing developer!</i></b>.

To do that, just edit the body parameter like this
<Image zoom src="/assets/running_your_project_2.png" alt="Updated Gazelle response" />

Save the changes to the file and Gazelle will hot-reload instantly.
You will see hot-reloading status in your terminal:
```console
✅ Running Project 'backend'...
Press 'r' to hot-reload the project.
Press 'R' to hot-restart.
Ctrl+c to exit.

The Dart VM service is listening on http://127.0.0.1:8181/RGz926BJ-bs=/
The Dart DevTools debugger and profiler is available at: http://127.0.0.1:8181/RGz926BJ-bs=/devtools?uri=ws://127.0.0.1:8181/RGz926BJ-bs=/ws
Reloaded <-- Gazelle detected the update and hot-reloaded.
```

Now, just reload your Flutter app and you should see the new response at the
center of the screen.

Amazing! You have just learn how to run and update a basic Gazelle full-stack
project.

## Next steps

In the next part, you will learn how the project is structured.
