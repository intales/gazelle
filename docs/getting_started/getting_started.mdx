# Getting started

This guide will walk you through setting up Gazelle on your machine and
how to create a new full-stack project.

## Prerequisites

To use Gazelle, make sure to have Flutter and Dart on your computer,
if you don't have that, please follow
[this guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and get back here
when you are ready!

After you made sure that Flutter is up and running on your machine,
install the Gazelle CLI with the following command:
```shell
dart pub global activate gazelle_cli
```
That's it! You are now ready to start building your full-stack application
with Gazelle and Flutter!

## Creating a full-stack project

Creating a full-stack project with Gazelle is pretty straight forward.
Open your favourite terminal and run:
```shell
gazelle create project --flutter
```
Gazelle will ask you for a project name, so get creative and type it into
the terminal!
```console
âœ¨ What would you like to name your new project? ðŸš€
my awesome app

âœ… my_awesome_app project created ðŸš€
ðŸ’¡ To navigate to your project run "cd my_awesome_app"
ðŸ’¡ Then, use "gazelle run" to execute it!
```
<b>Note</b>: project names should be written in <b><i>snake_case</i></b> format,
if you type them with <b><i>whitespaces</i></b> Gazelle will convert them in
<i>snake_case</i> automatically.

And you're done! You have just created a new full-stack project with Gazelle
and Dart!
