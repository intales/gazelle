# Creating routes

We have just created a new custom entity to define a user inside our system.
Now, we want to create a route to handle it.

## Create a new route

Creating a new route is fairly easy, the CLI will do that for us.
Open your terminal and type:
```shell
gazelle create route
```
The CLI will ask for a route name, let's type in <i>users</i>.
```console
âœ¨ What would you like to name your new route? ðŸš€
users

ðŸ’¡ users route created ðŸš€
```

If we open up the `backend/server/lib/routes` directory, we should see our
newly created <i>users</i> route with a simple <i>get</i> handler identical
to the <i>hello_gazelle</i> route.

## Updating the handler

Now we want to update our handler to return a list of users to the client.
Let's do that by replacing the default code to something like this:
```dart
import 'package:gazelle_core/gazelle_core.dart';
import 'package:models/models.dart';

class UsersGetHandler extends GazelleRouteHandler<List<User>> {
  const UsersGetHandler();

  @override
  Future<GazelleResponse<List<User>>> call(
    GazelleContext context,
    GazelleRequest request,
    GazelleResponse response,
  ) async {
    final users = [
      User(id: "1", name: "Richard Hendricks", username: "r.hendricks"),
      User(id: "2", name: "Elrick Bachman", username: "e.bachman"),
      User(id: "3", name: "Nelson Bighetti", username: "bighead"),
    ];

    return GazelleResponse(
      statusCode: GazelleHttpStatusCode.success.ok_200,
      body: users,
    );
  }
}
```

As you can see, we have changed the body type of the response from `String` to
`List<User>`, and updated the `call` method body to fetch some users and return
them to the client.

## Adding the route to the server

To add a route to the root of your server, open your `server.dart` file and
add `usersRoute` to the `routes` parameter of your Gazelle application:
```dart
Future<void> runApp(List<String> args) async {
  final app = GazelleApp(
    routes: [
      helloGazelleRoute,
      usersRoute,
    ],
    port: 3000,
    modelProvider: BackendModelProvider(),
  );

  await app.start(args: args);
}
```
Routes can also be nested, to do that, just add a route to the children
parameter of another route, but for the sake of this guide, we're going to
keep it simple.

## Update the client

We now need to update our client with the new API, so let's type
```shell
gazelle codegen client
```
inside our terminal.
The CLI should say that the client has been generated successfully.
```console
âœ… Client generated ðŸš€
Import the client in your Dart frontend application!
```

## Update the Flutter app

Now, we only need to update our UI to show our users in a list view.
Copy-paste the following code in your `main.dart` file:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:client/client.dart';

void main() {
  gazelle.init();

  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('my_awesome_app'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder(
            future: gazelle.client.api.users.get(),
            builder: (_, snapshot) => switch (snapshot) {
              AsyncSnapshot(:final data?) => UsersList(users: data),
              AsyncSnapshot(:final error?) =>
                Text('${error.runtimeType}: $error'),
              _ => const CircularProgressIndicator(),
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class UsersList extends StatelessWidget {
  const UsersList({
    required this.users,
    super.key,
  });

  final List<User> users;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListView.builder(
      itemCount: users.length,
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        final user = users[index];
        return ListTile(
          title: Text(user.name),
          subtitle: Text(user.username),
          leading: Text(user.id),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```
Start your app again like we did in [this part of the tutorial](/getting_started/running_your_project).
And that's it! You have just created a new API and used it into your Flutter
application.
The result should look something like this
