# Creating nested routes

Let's say that we want to add a delete user feature to our application.
We need a way to access the user we want to delete and ask the system to
actually delete it.

## Create a parametric route

To access our user we need to create a new route that has a dynamic path,
something like `/users/:userId`.
Let's start by creating a new route called `user_id` with the CLI:
```dart
gazelle create route
```
Open up the newly created route and edit the code to this:
```dart
final userId = GazelleRoute.parameter(
  name: "user_id",
).get(userIdGet);
```
The `parameter` constructor sets the current route as a dynamic route, we can
access the actual value of the route from the request parameter inside our
handler.

## Update our handler

Now we need to update the default handler to be a `DELETE` handler.
Rename the handler file to `user_id_delete.dart`, and update it with this code:
```dart
import 'package:gazelle_core/gazelle_core.dart';
import 'package:models/models.dart';
import 'package:server/users_collection.dart';

Future<GazelleResponse<User>> userIdDelete(
  GazelleContext context,
  GazelleRequest request,
) async {
  // Get the path parameter from the request.
  final userId = request.pathParameters["userId"]!;

  final deletedUser = usersCollection.singleWhere((user) => user.id == userId);

  usersCollection.remove(deletedUser);

  return GazelleResponse(
    statusCode: GazelleHttpStatusCode.success.ok_200,
    body: deletedUser,
  );
}
```

## Attach the new route to the `users` route

To register the `user_id` route under the `users` route, update the `users.dart`
route with this code:
```dart
import 'package:gazelle_core/gazelle_core.dart';
import 'package:server/routes/user_id/user_id.dart';
import 'package:server/routes/users/users_post.dart';
import 'users_get.dart';

final users = GazelleRoute(
  name: "users",
  children: [
    userId,
  ],
).get(usersGet).post(usersPost);
```
As you can see, we've added a child to the `children` property of the route.
This builds the hierarchy of your routes.
Run `gazelle codegen client` to update the frontend client!
