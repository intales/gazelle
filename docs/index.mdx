# Gazelle Framework Documentation
Welcome to the documentation for Gazelle, a lightweight and flexible backend framework written in Dart.
Gazelle is designed to make it easy to build HTTP servers with lightning-fast routing,
customizable request handling using hooks, and extendable functionality through plugins.

## Goals
Gazelle aims to achieve the following objectives:

1. **Lightweight HTTP Server**: Gazelle provides a lightweight HTTP server with a blazing-fast router, enabling efficient request handling.

2. **Flexible Request Handling**: The framework offers a system of hooks that allow you to execute functions before and after request handlers,
enabling customization such as authorization and logging.

3. **Extendable Architecture**: Gazelle features a plugin system that allows you to extend its functionality in a scalable and isolated manner.
Plugins implement the `GazellePlugin` interface, providing a seamless way to add new features to the framework.

## Key Concepts
### Hooks
Hooks in Gazelle are functions that can be executed before or after request handlers.
They enable you to perform tasks such as authentication, authorization, logging, and more.
With hooks, you can customize the behavior of your application at various stages of request processing.

### Plugins
Plugins are implementations of the `GazellePlugin` interface that extend the capabilities of the framework.
Whether you need to add authentication methods, integrate with external services, or implement custom features,
plugins offer a flexible and modular approach to enhancing Gazelle.

## Getting Started
To start using Gazelle in your projects, follow these simple steps:

1. Install Gazelle as a dependency in your Dart project.
2. Define your routes and request handlers using Gazelle's expressive API.
3. Enhance your application's functionality by leveraging hooks and plugins.
4. Deploy your Gazelle-powered server and enjoy its performance and flexibility.
