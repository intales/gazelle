# Overview

## What is Gazelle?

Gazelle is a backend framework written entirely into Dart that transforms
Flutter developers in full-stack developers!
Build your next application without any other language and share your logic
between the server and the client.

## How does it work?

Gazelle at its core is a HTTP server written in Dart that's easy to use,
has middleware support via hooks and has a plugin system to expand its
capabilites based on what you need to build.

## How do I use it?

You can write an entire application with Gazelle entirely by yourself, but
we've built a CLI to help you with project setup and maintenance.
The CLI is the best way to interact and work with Gazelle.

## What can I build with it?

Gazelle is meant for writing full-stack applications with Flutter, but you
can also use it to write a standalone backend or a full-stack application
built with a framework different from Flutter.

## Next steps

Follow the next steps to install the Gazelle CLI and setup your first
full-stack project.
