# Gazelle Plugin

Gazelle follows a modular architecture, and plugins play a central role in extending its capabilities.
Each plugin encapsulates a specific functionality or feature set, providing a clean and organized way to enhance Gazelle-based applications.

## How to create a plugin

Creating a plugin is easy and straight forward.
You only need to implement the `GazellePlugin` class and override the `initialize` method.
This method is called during the initialization phase of the plugin,
allowing it to perform any necessary setup or configuration, while giving you access to the
`GazelleContext`. Think of it like the `build` method that you ovveride in Flutter widgets.
Here's an example:
```dart
class MyPlugin extends GazellePlugin {
  @override
  Future<void> initialize(GazelleContext context) async {
    // Plugin initialization logic
  }
}
```

Once the plugin is implemented, it can be registered with a Gazelle application using the `registerPlugin` method.
This enables the plugin to extend the functionality of the application seamlessly.
```dart
final app = GazelleApp(
  plugins: [MyPlugin()],
);
```

## Initialization
During initialization, a plugin receives a reference to the GazelleContext object representing the application context.
This context provides access to the router and other essential components of the Gazelle framework, allowing the plugin to interact with the application seamlessly.

## Extensibility
Plugins in Gazelle are designed to be highly extensible and customizable.
They can interact with each other and with the application context, enabling developers to create complex and feature-rich applications with ease.

## Benefits
**Modularity**: Plugins promote modular design by encapsulating specific functionality, making it easier to maintain and extend Gazelle-based applications.

**Flexibility**: Developers can mix and match plugins to tailor the application to their specific requirements, adding or removing features as needed.

**Scalability**: The plugin architecture in Gazelle allows applications to scale gracefully as they grow in complexity, without sacrificing performance or maintainability.

That's it! You now understand how to use and create plugins for Gazelle.
