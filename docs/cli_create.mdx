# Create

The `create` command bootstraps a Gazelle project for you.
To create a basic project run:
```shell
gazelle create
```
This command will create a folder called `gazelle_app` with the necessary
setup to develop a Gazelle application.
Just dive into the `lib` folder and start creating your backend!

## Options
The `create` command offers a couple of options that you can change:
`--name` or `-n`, and `--path` or `-p`.
Here is a simple example:
```shell
gazelle create -n my_awesome_app -p ~/my_awesome_projects
```

The output of `create` command is something like this:
```
my_awesome_app project created!
Run `gazelle run my_awesome_app/bin/my_awesome_app.dart` to test it.
```
