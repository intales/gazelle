# Create

The `create` command helps you scaffolding a new Gazelle project and routes.
To create a new project run:
```shell
gazelle create project
```

This command will ask you the name of your application and will proceed
to create the necessary directories and files to have a working Gazelle project.
Here's an example:
```
$ gazelle create project
âœ¨ What would you like to name your new project? ðŸš€
my awesome app

âœ… my_awesome_app project created ðŸš€
ðŸ’¡To navigate to your project run "cd my_awesome_app"
ðŸ’¡Then, use "gazelle run" to execute it!
```

## Creating routes
You can also create routes for a Gazelle project with:
```shell
gazelle create route
```

This command will ask for a route name and will create a new directory under
the `routes` directory in your project:
```
$ gazelle create route
âœ¨ What would you like to name your new route? ðŸš€
my amazing route

âœ… my_amazing_route route created ðŸš€
```
