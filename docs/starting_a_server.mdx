# Starting a server

Starting a Gazelle server is pretty straight forward.
The server is represented by the `GazelleApp` class and it can be initialized
with a few parameters.
Here's a basic example:
```dart
void main() async {
  final app = GazelleApp();

  // Define routes
  app.get('/', (request) async => GazelleResponse(
    statusCode: 200,
    body: 'Hello, Gazelle!',
  ));

  // Start the server
  await app.start();
  print('Server is running at http://${app.address}:${app.port}');
}
```
In the example above, a `GazelleApp` is started without a specific port or address.
This can be useful locally to develop, test and debug your code; the default address
is `localhost` while the port is self-assigned by the operating system.

## Port and address settings
If you want to specify an address and/or a port, you only need to pass them to
`GazelleApp` constructor.
```dart
void main() async {
  final app = GazelleApp(address: '127.0.0.1', port: 3000);

  // Define routes
  app.get('/', (request) async => GazelleResponse(
    statusCode: 200,
    body: 'Hello, Gazelle!',
  ));

  // Start the server
  await app.start();
  print('Server is running at http://${app.address}:${app.port}');
}
```

## SSL Certificates
HTTPS is supported out of the box by Dart, you only need to reference your certificate
and private key files in the `GazelleSSLCertificate` class.
```dart
void main() async {
  final sslCertificate = GazelleSSLCertificate(
    certificatePath: 'path_to_cert.cert',
    privateKeyPath: 'path_to_private_key.key',
  );
  final app = GazelleApp(port: 443, sslCertificate: sslCertificate);

  // Define routes
  app.get('/', (request) async => GazelleResponse(
    statusCode: 200,
    body: 'Hello, Gazelle!',
  ));

  // Start the server
  await app.start();
  print('Server is running at https://${app.address}:${app.port}');
}
```

## Stopping a Sever
To stop a server, just call the `stop()` method, this will terminate your application.
```dart
void main() async {
  final sslCertificate = GazelleSSLCertificate(
    certificatePath: 'path_to_cert.cert',
    privateKeyPath: 'path_to_private_key.key',
  );
  final app = GazelleApp(port: 443, sslCertificate: sslCertificate);

  // Define routes
  app.get('/', (request) async => GazelleResponse(
    statusCode: 200,
    body: 'Hello, Gazelle!',
  ));

  // Start the server
  await app.start();
  print('Server is running at https://${app.address}:${app.port}');

  // Stop the server
  // If close is true, active connections will be close immediately.
  await app.stop(force: true);
}
```
