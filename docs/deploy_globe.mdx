# Deploy on Globe

## Setup
Firstly, you need to install the Globe CLI tool with the following command:
```shell
dart pub global activate globe_cli
```
Then, you need to login to your Globe account with the CLI:
```shell
globe login
```
You're now ready to deploy your Gazelle applications to Globe!

## Preapre your application
Globe needs a couple of settings to be able to work properly, so you need to
add a couple of lines of code to your project.

Go to your main file, for example `lib/my_awesome_app.dart`, you should see
something like this:
```dart
void runApp() async {
  final app = GazelleApp(
    routes: [
      GazelleRoute(
        name: "hello_gazelle",
        get: (context, request, response) => GazelleResponse(
          statusCode: GazelleHttpStatusCode.success.ok_200,
          body: "Hello, Gazelle!",
        ),
      ),
    ],
  );

  await app.start();
  print("Gazelle listening at ${app.serverAddress}");
}
```
You should edit the first lines of the `runApp` function like this:
```dart
void runApp() async {
  final port = int.tryParse(Platform.environment["PORT"] ?? "8080") ?? 8080;
  final app = GazelleApp(
    port: port,
    routes: [
      GazelleRoute(
        name: "hello_gazelle",
        get: (context, request, response) => GazelleResponse(
          statusCode: GazelleHttpStatusCode.success.ok_200,
          body: "Hello, Gazelle!",
        ),
      ),
    ],
  );

  await app.start();
  print("Gazelle listening at ${app.serverAddress}");
}
```
This is done to use the correct Globe TCP port.

## Deploy your application
You're now ready to deploy your app to Globe with the following command:
```shell
globe deploy
```
Just wait for the deployment to complete and your application will be up
and running in no time!
