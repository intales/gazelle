# Declaring Routes and Handlers

In Gazelle, you can easily declare routes and define handlers to process incoming HTTP requests using the expressive API provided by the framework.

## Declaring a Route
<Warning>Gazelle currently supports only **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, **PATCH**, and **DELETE** HTTP methods.</Warning>
To declare a route, use one of the HTTP methods (`get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`, `delete`, etc.) provided by `GazelleApp` or `GazelleContext`.
Here's how you can declare a route for handling GET requests:
```dart
final app = GazelleApp();

// Declaring a GET route for the path '/hello'
app.get('/hello', (request) async {
  return GazelleResponse(
    statusCode: 200,
    body: 'Hello, Gazelle!',
  );
});
```

### Defining a Request Handler
The request handler is a function that processes incoming requests and returns an appropriate response.
You can define request handlers using anonymous functions or named functions.
Here's an example of a request handler for the `/hello` route:
```dart
// Defining a request handler for the '/hello' route
GazelleResponse helloHandler(GazelleRequest request) async {
  return GazelleResponse(
    statusCode: 200,
    body: 'Hello, Gazelle!',
  );
}

// Declaring a GET route with the defined handler
app.get('/hello', helloHandler);
```

### Defining path parameters
You can also define path parameters such as `/user/:userID`.
Here's an example on how to do it:
```dart
// Defining a route with a path parameter
app.get(
  '/user/:userID', // Define the route path with the parameter :userID
  (request) async {
    // Access the value of the path parameter
    final userID = request.pathParameters['userID'];

    // Perform logic based on the userID
    final userData = getUserData(userID);

    if (userData != null) {
      return GazelleResponse(
        statusCode: 200,
        body: 'User data for userID $userID: $userData',
      );
    } else {
      return GazelleResponse(
        statusCode: 404,
        body: 'User not found for userID $userID',
      );
    }
  },
);
```

## Working with Hooks
Hooks in Gazelle allow you to execute functions before and after request handlers,
enabling you to customize the behavior of your application at various stages of request processing.

### Pre-request Hooks
Pre-request hooks are functions that are executed before a request is handled.
They can be used for tasks such as authentication, authorization, logging, etc.
If you want to interrupt the handling of a request by return a `GazelleResponse` object
inside the hook callback, otherwise just return the request to continue its processing.
You can also update the request via its `copyWith` method.
Here's an example of using a pre-request hook to authenticate requests:
```dart
// Creating a pre-request hook for authentication
final authenticationHook = GazellePreRequestHook(
  (request) async {
    // Perform authentication logic here
    if (!isAuthenticated(request)) {
      return GazelleResponse(
        statusCode: 401,
        body: 'Unauthorized',
      );
    }

    // If authentication succeeds, continue processing the request
    return request;
  },
  shareWithChildRoutes: true, // Share this hook with child routes, false by default
);

final app = GazelleApp();

// Declaring a GET route for the path '/protected'
app.get('/protected', (request) async {
  return GazelleResponse(
    statusCode: 200,
    body: 'Protected',
  );
 },
 preRequestHooks: [authenticationHook],
);

// Declaring a GET route for the path '/protected/user_info'
// Automatically inherits authentication hook from parent route
app.get('/protected/user_info', (request) async {
  return GazelleResponse(
    statusCode: 200,
    body: 'User Info',
  );
 },
);
```
In this example, the pre-request hook for authentication is applied to the main path `/protected`.
This hook will be automatically shared with all child routes under `/protected`, such as `/protected/user_info`.
Each request sent to these child routes will undergo the authentication hook before being handled by the respective request handling function.

### Post-response Hooks
Post-response hooks are functions that are executed after a response is generated.
They can be used for tasks such as logging, response modification, etc.
Post-response hooks receive the generated response and can modify it before it's sent back to the client.

<Warning>If you set the status code of the response between `400` and `599`, the server will stop processing
of post-response hooks and will send the error to the client.</Warning>

Here's an example of using a post-response hook to add custom headers to the response:
```dart
// Creating a post-response hook to add custom headers
final customHeadersHook = GazellePostResponseHook(
  (response) async {
    // Add custom headers to the response
    response.headers['X-Custom-Header'] = 'Value';

    // Optionally modify the response body or status code
    response.body += ' (modified)';
    response.statusCode = 200;

    // Return the modified response
    return response;
  },
  shareWithChildRoutes: true, // Share this hook with child routes, false by default
);

final app = GazelleApp();

// Declaring a GET route for the path '/data'
app.get('/data', (request) async {
  return GazelleResponse(
    statusCode: 200,
    body: 'Data',
  );
 },
);

// Declaring a GET route for the path '/data/info'
// Automatically inherits custom headers hook from parent route
app.get('/data/info', (request) async {
  return GazelleResponse(
    statusCode: 200,
    body: 'Info',
  );
 },
 postResponseHooks: [customHeadersHook],
);
```

In this example, the post-response hook for adding custom headers is applied to the main path `/data`.
This hook will be automatically shared with all child routes under `/data`, such as `/data/info`.
After the response is generated for each request, the post-response hook will be executed to add custom headers before sending the response back to the client.
