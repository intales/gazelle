# Declaring Routes and Handlers

In Gazelle, you can easily declare routes and define handlers to process incoming HTTP requests using the expressive API provided by the framework.

## Declaring a Route
<Info>Gazelle currently supports **GET**, **HEAD**, **POST**, **PUT**, **PATCH**, **DELETE** and **OPTIONS** HTTP methods.</Info>
Here's how you can declare a route for handling GET requests:
```dart
import 'package:gazelle_core/gazelle_core.dart';

void main() async {
  final app = GazelleApp(
    routes: [
      GazelleRoute(
        name: "hello_gazelle",
        get: (context, request, response) => GazelleResponse(
          statusCode: GazelleHttpStatusCode.success.ok_200,
          body: "Hello, Gazelle!",
        ),
      ),
    ],
  );
}
```
To use other methods, you can define their relative handlers inside a `GazelleRoute`:
```dart
import 'package:gazelle_core/gazelle_core.dart';

void main() async {
  final app = GazelleApp(
    routes: [
      GazelleRoute(
        name: "hello_gazelle",
        get: (context, request, response) => GazelleResponse(
          statusCode: GazelleHttpStatusCode.success.ok_200,
          body: "Hello, Gazelle!",
        ),
        post: (context, request, response) => GazelleResponse(
          statusCode: GazelleHttpStatusCode.success.ok_200,
          body: "(POST) Hello, Gazelle!",
        ),
      ),
    ],
  );
}
```

### HEAD and OPTIONS routes
Gazelle automatically creates an **OPTIONS** route for every route,
and a **HEAD** route for every **GET** route.

## Defining a Request Handler
The request handler is a function that processes incoming requests and returns an appropriate response.
You can define request handlers using anonymous functions or named functions.

<Warning>Prefer using named functions, as Dart VM does not detect anonymous functions changes while hot-reloading!</Warning>

Here's an example of a request handler for the `/hello` route:
```dart
// Defining a request handler for the '/hello' route
GazelleResponse helloHandler(GazelleRequest request, GazelleResponse response) async {
  return response.copyWith(
    statusCode: 200,
    body: 'Hello, Gazelle!',
  );
}

// Declaring a GET route with the defined handler
final helloRoute = GazelleRoute(
  name: "hello",
  get: helloHandler,
);

final app = GazelleApp(routes: [helloRoute]);
```

## Defining path parameters
You can also define path parameters such as `/user/:userID`.
Here's an example on how to do it:
```dart
// Defining a route with a path parameter
final userRoute = GazelleRoute(
  name: "user",
  children: [
    GazelleRoute.parameter(
      name: "userID",
      get: (context, request, response) => GazelleResponse(
        statusCode: GazelleHttpStatusCode.success.ok_200,
        body: "Hello, ${request.pathParameters["userID"]}!",
      ),
    ),
  ],
);
```
